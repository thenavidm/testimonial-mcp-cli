 * npx starts a binary named after the package when the package's binaries
 * point to different files. When they all share one file it starts whichever
 * one the registry lists first, and the registry does not keep the order they
 * were published in, so it could start testimonial-cli and hand an MCP client the
 * command list instead of a server. This file starts the entry as testimonial-mcp.
